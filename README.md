# sql-DWH-project
Creating a modern DWL using SQL server. Including ETL processes, Data modeling, and simple analytics.


Hello! This is a Project where i will be expanding my SQL server knowledge. I will be taking sample data and passing it through different ETL processes through three different layers (bronze, silver, and gold). Bronze will ingest the data, silver will clean the data, and gold will analyze and transform it based on business rules.
